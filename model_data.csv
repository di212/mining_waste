One of its major goals is to develop and specify materials and processes that will help reducing its environmental footprint through resource and energy conservation, as well as renewable energy generation. In 2010 MC announced on its website a prized-competition for the best proposal of \u201cSustainable Concrete\u201d and \u201cLowest Carbon Footprint\u201d to build MC with a total of two million cubic meter of concrete on 4 years period. This paper presents the experimental test results of 13 types of concrete mixes made with high volume of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) cement with 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) to reduce the carbon emissions. A fly ash-blended mix made with 30% fly ash was also tested. The paper provides more information on the mix design parameter, full justification of CO2 footprint, and cost reduction for each concrete type. The hardened and plastic properties and durability test parameters for each mix are presented. The results show that the slag concrete mixes significantly reduce the carbon footprint and meet the requirements of MC. An economical mix with 80% GGBFS and 20% OPC was nominated for use in the future construction of MC with 154kg/m3 carbon foot print.}\n}"",

One of its major goals is to develop and specify materials and processes that will help reducing its environmental footprint through resource and energy conservation, as well as renewable energy generation. In 2010 MC announced on its website a prized-competition for the best proposal of \u201cSustainable Concrete\u201d and \u201cLowest Carbon Footprint\u201d to build MC with a total of two million cubic meter of concrete on 4 years period. This paper presents the experimental test results of 13 types of concrete mixes made with high volume of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) cement with 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) to reduce the carbon emissions. A fly ash-blended mix made with 30% fly ash was also tested. The paper provides more information on the mix design parameter, full justification of CO2 footprint, and cost reduction for each concrete type. The hardened and plastic properties and durability test parameters for each mix are presented. The results show that the slag concrete mixes significantly reduce the carbon footprint and meet the requirements of MC. An economical mix with 80% GGBFS and 20% OPC was nominated for use in the future construction of MC with 154kg/m3 carbon foot print.}\n}",,,,,,,,,,

End-users look for the highest purity of minerals. Run-of-mine ore is beneficiated through particle size reduction, liberation, separation, and concentration using physical and surface chemical properties. Ore is crushed, grinded, and classified. Valuable minerals are concentrated by leaching and sorting with light reflectance, gamma radiation, and X-ray luminescence. Gravity concentration is possible by panning, jigging, spiraling, shaking table, and multigravity and dense medium separation. Magnetic and electrostatic properties aid in concentration. The majority of ore (Cu, Zn, Pb, platinum-group elements, etc.) is best suited to froth flotation, which includes conditioning of fine liberated particles and reagents like collectors, depressors, regulators, and frothers. Slurry passes through rougher-scavenger cells and concentrates. Concentrates are cleaned by washing, sedimentation, and dewatering. Rejects are disposed to tailing ponds or used for the void-filling stabilization of underground stopes. Column flotation improves quality and recovery. Plant performance is judged by metallurgical accounting, metal balancing, operating cost, quantity, purity, recovery, and valuation. Extractive pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and refining processes recover the purest metals from concentrates.}\n}""",,,,,,,,,,

One of its major goals is to develop and specify materials and processes that will help reducing its environmental footprint through resource and energy conservation, as well as renewable energy generation. In 2010 MC announced on its website a prized-competition for the best proposal of \u201cSustainable Concrete\u201d and \u201cLowest Carbon Footprint\u201d to build MC with a total of two million cubic meter of concrete on 4 years period. This paper presents the experimental test results of 13 types of concrete mixes made with high volume of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) cement with 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) to reduce the carbon emissions. A fly ash-blended mix made with 30% fly ash was also tested. The paper provides more information on the mix design parameter, full justification of CO2 footprint, and cost reduction for each concrete type. The hardened and plastic properties and durability test parameters for each mix are presented. The results show that the slag concrete mixes significantly reduce the carbon footprint and meet the requirements of MC. An economical mix with 80% GGBFS and 20% OPC was nominated for use in the future construction of MC with 154kg/m3 carbon foot print.}\n}"",

End-users look for the highest purity of minerals. Run-of-mine ore is beneficiated through particle size reduction, liberation, separation, and concentration using physical and surface chemical properties. Ore is crushed, grinded, and classified. Valuable minerals are concentrated by leaching and sorting with light reflectance, gamma radiation, and X-ray luminescence. Gravity concentration is possible by panning, jigging, spiraling, shaking table, and multigravity and dense medium separation. Magnetic and electrostatic properties aid in concentration. The majority of ore (Cu, Zn, Pb, platinum-group elements, etc.) is best suited to froth flotation, which includes conditioning of fine liberated particles and reagents like collectors, depressors, regulators, and frothers. Slurry passes through rougher-scavenger cells and concentrates. Concentrates are cleaned by washing, sedimentation, and dewatering. Rejects are disposed to tailing ponds or used for the void-filling stabilization of underground stopes. Column flotation improves quality and recovery. Plant performance is judged by metallurgical accounting, metal balancing, operating cost, quantity, purity, recovery, and valuation. Extractive pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and refining processes recover the purest metals from concentrates.}\n}"",

  abstract  = ""Solar energy is commonly seen as a future energy source with
               significant potential. Ruthenium, gallium, indium and several
               other rare elements are common and vital components of many
               solar energy technologies, including dye-sensitized solar cells,
               CIGS cells and various artificial photosynthesis approaches.
               This study surveys solar energy technologies and their reliance
               on rare metals such as indium, gallium, and ruthenium. Several
               of these rare materials do not occur as primary ores, and are
               found as byproducts associated with primary base metal ores.
               This will have an impact on future production trends and the
               availability for various applications. In addition, the
               geological reserves of many vital metals are scarce and severely
               limit the potential of certain solar energy technologies. It is
               the conclusion of this study that certain solar energy concepts
               are unrealistic in terms of achieving TW scales."",

Garvlehn},keywords = {Environmental impact, Life cycle assessment, Nuclear, Wind, Hydro, China study},abstract = {Energy sector is one of biggest contributors to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, it has attracted considerable attention to reduce the GHG emissions of electricity production. Hydro-electric, nuclear and wind power are the top three clean energy in China. In this study, the environmental impacts of these three technologies are analyzed, assessed and compared via a life-cycle assessment approach. The entire life cycle, including the manufacturing, construction, operation and decommissioning stages is examined. Apart from global warming potential (GWP100) caused by GHG emissions, the environmental impacts assessed in this study also included acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) and human toxicity potential (HTP). The results show that wind power technology has the most significant environmental impacts amongst these three clean energies, followed by nuclear power and hydropower. For example, in terms of global warming potential, wind power produces 28.6 ± 3.2 g CO2-eq/kWh of GWP100 throughout its life cycle, which is higher than that of nuclear power (12.4 ± 1.5 g CO2-eq/kWh) and hydropower (3.5 ± 0.4 g CO2-eq/kWh). In addition, this study revealed that the the manufacturing stage is the largest contributor of environmental impacts for wind and hydropower. By contrast, the decommissioning stage is most significant for nuclear power in terms of environmental impacts. The comparative life cycle assessment method proposed in this study provides useful tool for the future environmental assessment of electricity production technologies. Findings of this study provide useful inputs for the sustainable transformation of the energy sector.}",,https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1802/v/pp1802v.pdf,,,,,,,
